# 👋 Hello, I'm Bela Arwen

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I am currently pursuing an MA in Physics at Stony Brook University, where I conduct research in Dr. Vivian Miranda’s Cosmology group. My academic journey began with a BA in Astronomy and Physics, with a minor in Mathematics, and has evolved into a passion for unraveling the mysteries of our universe through both observation and theory.
